# Changelog

## [0.1.4] - 2026-10-05

- Added: requests send an `X-Rivium-SDK` header (`android/<version>`); `RiviumChatConfig.SDK_VERSION` gives the SDK version.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-26

- Added: `lastMessage` and `unreadCount` on `Room`. A chat list can show the
  latest message and an unread badge from `listRooms()` alone, with no extra
  calls.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-12

- Added: `tokenProvider` for secure user identity. Tokens are refreshed automatically before they expire and after an expired-token response.
- Added: `onAuthError` flow for identity errors a refresh cannot fix.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-09

- Fixed: subscribing to a room could throw "Subscription to a channel already exists" after leaving and rejoining it.
- Fixed: `subscribeToRoom` could report success while a channel had not subscribed, leaving the room without live updates.
- Fixed: presence and typing channels reported nothing when a subscribe failed.
- Added: `isRoomSubscribed()` and `subscribedChannelsFor()` to check subscription state.
- Added: `reconnect()` to recover a stale connection.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-26

- Initial release
